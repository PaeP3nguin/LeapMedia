# LeapMedia
### Dead simple media controls for Windows with Leap Motion.
A lot of [Leap Media computer control applications][1] either cost money or are rather slow and unintuitive to use.
In addition, I wanted to mount my Leap under my monitor facing downwards for a cleaner look.
I whipped together LeapMedia to remedy my first-world problems.

#### Features:
* Fast and easy gestures
* Minimizes to the taskbar
* Simulates Windows media keys for maximum application compatibility
* Minimal CPU usage - Leap Motion's own software uses plenty of CPU already
* Not too much memory usage - about 25MB

#### Anti-features:
* No configuration options via UI
* Made for top-down usage

## Controls
* Play/Pause: stretch your fingers away from each other
* Next/prev track: rotate your hand from the wrist to the left or right
* Volume up/down: rotate your hand clockwise or counterclockwise
* Mute: move your hand far from the Leap
